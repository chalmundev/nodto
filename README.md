## Events
Anyone can create an event.

Options:
- max_invites: u64,
- self_register: bool,
- difficulty: u8,
- payment:
	- token_id: String
	- amount: u128

*if `max_invites` is not specified, the payment amount will default to zero*

Only the event creator (owner) can add hosts. When you add a host you must pay `max_invites * payment.amount`, held in the contract as a bounty for the host.

## Hosts

Every host has a `host_id`, a u64 integer which is mapped to their NEAR account_id. Hosts can look this up using `get_host_id(account_id: AccountId) -> u64` it is the same across all events.

When hosts are finished inviting guests, they can claim their bounty using `host_withdraw`. This method can ONLY be called once. Therefore hosts should do this when they are either finished inviting and think no more guests will sign up with their `host_id` or when they have reached the `max_invites`.

Guests can still register after a host has been paid but the host will no longer be able to receive the funds.

## Guests

Guests can register by providing a valid `host_id` for a host of the event. OR, if `self_register` is enabled, guests can add themselves. Self registered guests do not count toward any bounty payouts.

Guests must complete a PoW to prove they are unique. This prevents list spam and malicious hosts.

# React 17, Parcel with useContext and useReducer
- Bundled with Parcel 2.0 (@next) && eslint
- *Minimal all-in-one state management with async/await support*

## Getting Started: State Store & useContext

>The following steps are already done, but describe how to use `src/utils/state` to create and use your own `store` and `StateProvider`.

1. Create a file e.g. `/state/app.js` and add the following code
```js
import { State } from '../utils/state';

// example
const initialState = {
	app: {
		mounted: false
	}
};

export const { store, Provider } = State(initialState);
```
2. Now in your `index.js` wrap your `App` component with the `StateProvider`
```js
import { Provider } from './state/app';

ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider>
        <App />
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```
3. Finally in `App.js` you can `useContext(store)`
```js
const { state, dispatch, update } = useContext(store);
```

## Usage in Components
### Print out state values
```js
<p>Hello {state.foo && state.foo.bar.hello}</p>
```
### Update state directly in component functions
```js
const handleClick = () => {
    update('clicked', !state.clicked);
};
```
### Dispatch a state update function (action listener)
```js
const onMount = () => {
    dispatch(onAppMount('world'));
};
useEffect(onMount, []);
```
## Dispatched Functions with context (update, getState, dispatch)

When a function is called using dispatch, it expects arguments passed in to the outer function and the inner function returned to be async with the following json args: `{ update, getState, dispatch }`

Example of a call:
```js
dispatch(onAppMount('world'));
```

All dispatched methods **and** update calls are async and can be awaited. It also doesn't matter what file/module the functions are in, since the json args provide all the context needed for updates to state.

For example:
```js
import { helloWorld } from './hello';

export const onAppMount = (message) => async ({ update, getState, dispatch }) => {
	update('app', { mounted: true });
	update('clicked', false);
	update('data', { mounted: true });
	await update('', { data: { mounted: false } });

	console.log('getState', getState());

	update('foo.bar', { hello: true });
	update('foo.bar', { hello: false, goodbye: true });
	update('foo', { bar: { hello: true, goodbye: false } });
	update('foo.bar.goodbye', true);

	await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => {
		console.log('getState', getState());
		resolve();
	}, 2000));

	dispatch(helloWorld(message));
};
```
## Prefixing store and Provider

The default names the `State` factory method returns are `store` and `Provider`. However, if you want multiple stores and provider contexts you can pass an additional `prefix` argument to disambiguate.

```js
export const { appStore, AppProvider } = State(initialState, 'app');
```

## Performance and memo

The updating of a single store, even several levels down, is quite quick. If you're worried about components re-rendering, use `memo`:
```js
import React, { memo } from 'react';

const HelloMessage = memo(({ message }) => {
	console.log('rendered message');
	return <p>Hello { message }</p>;
});

export default HelloMessage;
```
Higher up the component hierarchy you might have:
```js
const App = () => {
	const { state, dispatch, update } = useContext(appStore);
    ...
	const handleClick = () => {
		update('clicked', !state.clicked);
	};

	return (
		<div className="root">
			<HelloMessage message={state.foo && state.foo.bar.hello} />
			<p>clicked: {JSON.stringify(state.clicked)}</p>
			<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
		</div>
	);
};
```
When the button is clicked, the component HelloMessage will not re-render, it's value has been memoized (cached). Using this method you can easily prevent performance intensive state updates in further down components until they are neccessary.
